# Contribution Guidelines

Ensure your pull request complies to the following guidelines:

- Start your topic and commits with a keyword like Add, Change, Remove or Bugfix.
- Don't use filenames in PR.
- Proof-read yourself.
- Please be nice.
- Be brave with contributing and commenting.
- Consider if the item you're adding to the list is actually pretty useful and/or exciting for the Nocode / Lowcode community or newcomers.
- In case we gather a lot of links that are kinda-useful, but not exactly awesome, we could create another list within the repo.

Thank you for your suggestions!

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
